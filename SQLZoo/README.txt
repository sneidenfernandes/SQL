# SQL Zoo: Rudimentary Querying 

In this project, I've used the SQL Zoo exercise datasets and a local MySQL database to explore rudimentary SQL concepts. Each section of the project focuses on specific exercises, where I explain the tables, execute queries, and share my thoughts during the learning process.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- Understand basic SQL queries by tackling real-world scenarios using SQL Zoo exercise datasets.
- Demonstrate my ability to set up and query into a local database.
- Analyze and interpret the data to gain valuable insights and observations.

## Setup

To replicate this project locally, you'll need the following:

1. MySQL Server: Install and configure a local MySQL server. You can download it from [mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com/).
2. Datasets: Download the SQL Zoo exercise dataset dump files.
3. Python Environment: Set up a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries (`mysql.connector` and `pandas`).

## Sections

The project is divided into sections as per 'https://sqlzoo.net' , each corresponding to a group of SQL exercises. Here's a brief overview of what each section covers:

    - Exercise name
    - Description of the dataset and table structure.
    - Execution of queries with explanations.


## How to Run

To run this project locally:

1. Set up your MySQL server and create the necessary database.
2. Load the datasets from SQL Zoo exercise dump files into your local database.
3. Configure the MySQL server my providing the requisite credentials in the 'query.py' file.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook for the project.
5. Run each section's code cells sequentially.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Notebooks/`: Contains a 'query.py' file and Jupyter Notebook files for each section.
- `Dumpfiles/`: Includes SQL Zoo exercise dataset dump files.
- `README.md`: You're reading it!

## Technologies Used
