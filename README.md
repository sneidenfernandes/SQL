# SQL 

Welcome to my SQL Repository! This collection contains a variety of SQL excercises from various sites. I will be solving queries and documenting more sites as I go along. 


Till date, the sites I've covered are structured into folders as mentioned below:

- SQLZoo  (https://www.SQLzoo.net)
- SQL CLimber (https://www.sqlclimber.com)

Each folder contains exercises related to a specefic site which contains solutions.  



To clone the repository use: 

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-practice.git
