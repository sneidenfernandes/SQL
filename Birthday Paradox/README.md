## Birthday Paradox

The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, is a counterintuitive phenomenon in probability theory. It involves the likelihood of two people in a group sharing the same birthday, even in relatively small groups.

The paradox states that in a group of just 23 people, there is already a more than 50% chance that at least two of them share the same birthday. This might seem counterintuitive because our instinctive perception often leads us to believe that a larger group is required for such a high probability of shared birthdays.

This code simulates the birthday paradox. I came across this in piece of code in Allen B. Downey's book. "Think Python."
